# Sales Forecasting Project

## Overview  
A comprehensive sales forecasting project designed to predict future sales trends using statistical and machine learning models. The project leverages historical sales data to build accurate forecasts and assist business decision-making.

## Features  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization  
- Time series forecasting models (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing)  
- Machine Learning models for regression  
- Model evaluation using performance metrics  
- Clear, organized code with reusable functions  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pavi0307/sales-forecasting-project.git
   ```  
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):  
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```  
3. Install required packages:  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage  
- Prepare your sales data CSV files in the `/data` directory.  
- Run the forecasting scripts located in the `/script` folder, e.g.:  
  ```
  python script/arima_forecast.py
  ```  
- View results and visualizations in output folders.

## Project Structure  
```
/data                      # Raw and processed datasets  
/script                    # Forecasting and analysis scripts  
README.md                  # Project overview and instructions  
requirements.txt           # Python dependencies  
```
